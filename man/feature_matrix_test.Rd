\title{Test feature matrix}
\usage{
feature_matrix_test(my_data,match_date = "2019-01-01",features = c('surface_form', 'age', 'match_form', 'head_to_head'), carpet = 'FALSE')
}
\arguments{
\item{my_data}{input data.}

\item{match_date}{set to the starting date of test data - be default is 2019-01-01.}

\item{features}{a list of features wanted to be included. By default all features are used.}

\item{carpet}{as matches are no longer played on carpet, carpet performance is by default not included. However, carpet can be included by including, carpet == 'TRUE'.}
}
\value{
Creates a matrix where each row is a feature and each column is a match. Additionally, a row of ones is added for the intercept.
}
\description{
Makes the feature matrix to test model based on which features are chosen. Uses functions: player_data_frame, head_to_head, feature_surface.
As this is the testing matrix, the columns are the matches we wish to predict but the player characteristics are still calculated from the training data.

\examples{
feature_matrix_test(my_data)
feature_matrix_test(my_data,match_date = "2016-01-01",features = c('surface_form', 'age'), carpet = 'TRUE')
